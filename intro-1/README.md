#Intro 1: What is a binary, really?

In short, a binary is what happens when you take high level code such as C or
C++, and compile it into something the computer can actually run. I believe in
hands on learning, so we can take a look inside one to really find out.

Consider the file [hello_world.c](hello_world.c):
```C
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
}
```

This is your average C file, more or less. It's got a main, some includes, and
a little bit of code to be run. However, your computer can't actually run it.
In order to make it usable, we can run:
```
gcc -m32 hello_world.c -o hello_world.bin
```
You can ignore the `-m32` argument (you'll learn about it later), but the 
`-o hello_world.bin` simply specifies what the name of the output file is.
