# Glossary of Terms

Note: If you have a term you'd like added to the list, add an Issue or open a Pull Request.

## Technical Terms

* **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization):** Security measure in modern OSes to randomize stack and libc addresses on each program execution.

* **Binary:** A binary is the output file from compiling a C or C++ file. Anything in the
binary has a *constant address* (usually... see PIE.)

* **Canary:** A canary is some (usually random) value that is used to verify that
nothing has been overrwritten. Programs may place canaries in memory, and
check that they still have the exact same value after running potentially
dangerous code, verifying the integrity of that memory.

* **GOT (Global Offset Table):** The GOT is a table of addresses stored in the data section of memory. Executed programs use it to look up the runtime addresses of global variables that are unknown at compile time.

* **Heap:** The heap is a far more reliable memory space similar to the stack.
However, usage of the heap has to be invoked by the coder, so heap problems are
often their own category of exploitation

* **libc:** A binary is *dynamically linked* and has a libc file. This means that
the whole set of standard library functions are located somewhere in the memory used
by the program.

* **NX (Non-Executable):** Security measure in modern OSes to separate processor instructions (code) and data (everything that's not code.) This prevents memory from being both executable and writable.

* **PIE (Position Independent Executable):** Essentially ASLR, but for the binary itself.
When this protection is enabled, locations of actual code in the binary are randomized.

* **PLT (Procedure Linkage Table):** The PLT is essentially a wrapper function for all
functions directly called in the binary. *Only used in dynamically
linked binaries*.

* **ROP (Return Oriented Programming):** Reusing tiny bits of code throughout the binary to construct commands we want to execute.

* **Stack:** The stack is part of the memory for a binary. Local variables and
pointers are often stored here. The stack can be randomized.


## Important Functions to Watch Out For:

TODO: ADD MORE.

* `mprotect()`: This is the function responsible for setting page pivilieges. If
you can call this function with your own arbitrary arguments, you can
effectively bypass NX protection.

* `system()`: This function can be used to execute commands or even other
binaries if called properly. I think it defaults to sh to handle commands on
most Linux flavors.

## General Terms

* **Arbitrary:** This word is used to imply the fullness of control that you
might have given an exploit. If you've achieved *arbitrary code execution*, that means you can run, read, or write whatever commands you choose.

* **Reliable:** Reliable in the context of binary exploitation is almost exactly
the same as regular use. An exploit is said to be reliable if it works across
different runs consistently. It might seem dumb to define this work, but
somtimes with exploits you will only have the option to make an unreliable
exploit.
