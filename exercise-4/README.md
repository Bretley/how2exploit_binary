#Pay a visit to your Local Library

At this point you're probably used to hunting through binaries for useful
functions or code that you can use to get a shell. But what do you do without a
call to `system()`?

The simple answer: get a shell anyways. :)

The long answer is a bit more complicated. This attack is called a return to
libc, or ret2libc for short. If you don't remember the PLT and GOT from before,
now is a good time to check the [glossary](../terms) and maybe do some
googling. You'll recall that ASLR randomizes the libc address, but the good
news is that with arbitrary `read()` and `write()` you can easily circumvent
this.
