#how2exploit_binary: get your hack on.

### A note from the creator

Greetings, fellow hacker, hobbyist, or computer enthusiast. If you've been
looking for a place to start learning binary exploitation, then you're in luck.
This tutorial is intended for anyone with experience in coding, Ideally C or
C++, but I only knew Python when I started.
Written by someone who is just barely better than "incompetent," I'll be
explaining how I learned my skills. These tutorials will be a bit long winded,
but hopefully they will be informative and entertaining. Please feel free to
contact me about any clarifications that should be included in the tutorials.

**This is intended for linux. It's free if you don't already have it. Don't
want to dual boot? Get a VM.**

-Best of luck
