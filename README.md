#how2exploit_binary: get your hack on.

### A note from the creator

Greetings, fellow hacker, hobbyist, or computer enthusiast. If you've been
looking for a place to start learning binary exploitation, then you're in luck.
This tutorial is intended for anyone with experience in coding, Ideally C or
C++, but I only knew Python when I started.
Written by someone who is just barely better than "incompetent," I'll be
explaining how I learned my skills. These tutorials will be a bit long winded,
but hopefully they will be informative and entertaining. Please feel free to
contact me about any clarifications that should be included in the tutorials.

**This is intended for linux. It's free if you don't already have it. Don't
want to dual boot? Get a VM.**

-Best of luck

##The Grand Glossary of Terms
I've compiled this list of as many useful things as I could find. It contains
all sorts of goodies that I wish I had found or had explained to me earlier. If
you have a question, it can probably be answered in here. Otherwise, get your
Google-Fu on

* [The Glossary](terms)

##External Tools.
I strongly recommend you install and use the following tools to make your life
a bit easier:

* [longld/peda](https://github.com/longld/peda/) I use this tool in all of
  these tutorials. It provides a wide range of useful functions and makes gdb
far more user friendly. Just follow the install instructions in the repo.

* [Gallopsled/pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) pwntools is an
  exploit framework built in my favorite language, python. It has a whole slew
of useful functions and chicanery that makes the exploit process more fun and
less painful. It can be installed by running `sudo pip intall pwntools`
