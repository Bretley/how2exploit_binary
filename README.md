# how2exploit_binary
Greetings, fellow hacker, hobbyist, or computer enthusiast. If you've been
looking for a place to start learning binary exploitation, then you're in luck.
Written by someone who is just barely better than "incompetent," I'll be
explaining how I learned my skills. These tutorials will be a bit long winded,
but hopefully they will be informative and entertaining. Please feel free to
contact me about any clarifications that should be included in the tutorials.

-Best of luck
