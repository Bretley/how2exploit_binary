#Getting Started

This tutorial is geared at getting you ready for the challenges ahead. It might
seem scary, but don't worry, you'll get there. First, some terms you should
know.

**Binary:** The binary is the compiled C or C++ file. Anything that is in the
binary has a *constant address.*

**libc:** A binary the is *dynamically linked* has a libc file. This means that
the whole set of standard library functions are somewhere in memory to be used
by the program

**PLT:** Stands for . The PLT is essentially a wrapper function for all
functions directly called in the binary. *These are only used in dynamically
linked binaries*

**GOT:** Stands for Global Offset Table. The GOT is a string of pointers into
libc. The PLT calls whatever address is loaded into the GOT at runtime.

**Stack:** The stack is part of the memory for a binary. Local variables and
pointers are often stored here. The stack can be randomized.

**ASLR:**  Stands for Address Space Layout Randomization. This means that the
stack and libc addresses are randomized from runtime to runtime.
